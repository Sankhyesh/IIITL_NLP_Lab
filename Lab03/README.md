## Link to data

* Please [follow this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19QbfqC-E-LFcAfnRe_DtP_co9m91p_mC?usp=sharing) to get access to the data we have uploaded in a GDrive. 
* Please download the dataset and have a look at the files you need to process.

### Dataset Description

* Some data has been acquired from a recent shared task (the files with .zip extension) and can be used as-is for the task.
* Some data has been acquired from the WikiANN (sometimes known as PAN-X) dataset and have a langauge identifier present with the tokens. You need to make sure that the language identifier is not passed in the model training as you will be training a monolingual NER model, i.e., an NER model for a Single Language.
